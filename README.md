# Heirarchical-Clustering-for-Scanpath
Compare the scanpaths of multiple participants and estimate a single common gaze path taken by all participants using heirarchical clustering
Below figure shows a dotplot between two participants:

Below graphs show reduced scanpath between 10 participants for 4 groups(PSQN0,PSQN1,PSQL0,PSQL1):
